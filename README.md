## What is CMC?

CMC is a Python-powered console that brings together file operations, GitHub publishing, Docker control, a fully local AI assistant, automation macros, and more — all with one consistent, easy-to-remember command syntax.

No need to remember different CLI tools. One console, one language.

---

## Features

|   | Feature | Example |
|:--:|---|---|
| 🚀 | **Git publishing** — create repos, commit, push in one step | `git upload`, `git update "my message"` |
| 🔄 | **Macros & chains** — save and run multi-step automation | `macro add deploy = backup ..., git update` |
| 🤖 | **Local AI assistant** — runs fully offline via Ollama | `ai how do I zip a folder and push it?` |
| 📁 | **File operations** — copy, move, zip, backup, search | `backup 'C:/Project' 'C:/Backups'` |
| 🛡️ | **Dry-run + Undo** — preview or reverse almost any action | `dry-run on`, `undo` |
| 🔍 | **Fast global search** — index drives, search instantly | `/build C D`, `/find ProjectName` |
| ☕ | **Java version switcher** — switch versions, CMC handles UAC | `java change 17` |
| 🏗️ | **Project scaffolding** — spin up Flask, React, Node, and more | `new flask`, `setup`, `dev` |
| 🐳 | **Docker** — container control + power commands | `docker ps`, `docker watch myapp` |

## Git — publish anything in seconds

CMC wraps Git into a handful of commands that handle the things you actually do 90% of the time. No init, no remote add, no branch juggling unless you need it.

```
git upload                                          Create a new GitHub repo from the current folder.
                                                    Handles init, first commit, push — all in one.

git update "message"                                Commit + push to the linked repo.

git update Owner/Repo "message" --add src/app.py   Partial commit — only stages one file or folder.

git download Owner/Repo                             Clone any repo into the current folder.

git link Owner/Repo                                 Link current folder to an existing repo.

git force update                                    When git is broken — auto-repairs and retries.

git branch create my-feature                        New branch, switches to it immediately.
git branch merge my-feature                         Merges into current branch.

git repo delete Owner/OldRepo                       Deletes remote repo. Requires typing DELETE.

git doctor                                          Diagnoses token, remote, and branch issues.
```

## Macros — automate anything

Macros are the most powerful part of CMC. They chain any commands together with commas, support variables, and run the entire chain in one word. Build them once, run them forever.

```
macro add <name> = <cmd1>, <cmd2>, <cmd3>
macro run <name>
macro edit <name>      Re-opens the command pre-filled for editing
macro list
```

**Variables:** `%HOME%`  `%DATE%`  `%NOW%`

**Examples:**

```
macro add backup = backup 'C:/MyProject' '%HOME%/Backups'

macro add deploy = batch on, backup 'C:/MyProject' '%HOME%/Backups', git update "deploy %NOW%", batch off

macro add clean = dry-run on, space '%HOME%/Downloads' depth 3 report
```

Running `deploy` does a timestamped backup and a git push — all in one word, no confirmations.

---

## Aliases

For single-command shortcuts:

```
alias add dl = explore '%HOME%/Downloads'
alias add proj = cd 'C:/MyProject'
```

---

## AI Assistant

Runs locally via Ollama — no internet required after setup. The AI sees your current folder listing, recent command log, active macros, and aliases, so answers are specific to your session.

```
ai <question>                    Ask anything — context-aware
ai fix                           Auto-explain the last failed command
ai clear                         Reset conversation history
ai-model set qwen2.5:14b-instruct   Switch to the heavy model (better reasoning)
ai-model set llama3.1:8b            Switch back to the light model
```

**Models:**
| Model | Size | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `llama3.1:8b` | ~5 GB | Fast everyday questions (default) |
| `qwen2.5:14b-instruct` | ~9 GB | Complex reasoning, longer explanations |

<details>
<summary>🐳 Docker</summary>

Standard Docker commands simplified (`ps`, `start`, `stop`, `shell`, `logs`, `build`, `compose`, etc.) plus some power commands not in the standard CLI:

```
docker wait <name>          Poll until healthy
docker errors <name>        Filter logs to errors only
docker env run <image>      Inject .env vars and run
docker backup <name>        Save config to timestamped zip
docker clone <name> <new>   Duplicate a container
docker watch <name>         Live logs + stats overlay
docker size <image>         Layer-by-layer size breakdown
docker port-check           Check compose ports vs system
```

Type `help 14` inside CMC for the full Docker reference.

## Safety

- **`dry-run on`** — preview what any command would do; nothing actually runs
- **`batch on`** — skip all confirmation prompts (useful inside macros)
- **`undo`** — reverse the last action up to 30 steps
- **`status`** — see current modes, AI model, Java version, macro count, undo depth

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11
- Python 3.10+
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/) — for Git features
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) — for the AI assistant (optional)

---

## Manuals

Full command references are in the `manuals/` folder:

- `CMC_AI_Manual_MINI.md` — compact reference for the light AI model (8b)
- `CMC_AI_Manual_MEDIUM.md` — full reference for the heavy AI model (14b)
- `AI_Manual.txt` — comprehensive technical reference for external AI use
