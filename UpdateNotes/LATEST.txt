Computer Main Centre - Release Notes (19/02/2026)

[ Header & Status ]

- Header is now compact and minimal — shows Batch, Dry-Run, AI model, and CMC update status
- SSL and Java version moved out of the header and into the 'status' command
- 'status' command now shows a full panel: all modes, AI model, Java, CMC update, macro/alias counts, and undo depth
- CMC update status now checks in the background on startup so the console opens instantly
- Update check now works for zip installs (no longer requires a .git folder)

[ First-Time Welcome ]

- First launch shows a welcome panel and pre-fills 'help' in the prompt
- Only appears once, never shown again after that

[ AI Assistant ]

- AI now sees the full body of your macros and aliases, not just their names
- Added conversation history — follow-up questions work within a session
- Added 'ai fix' — automatically diagnoses the last failed command
- Added 'ai clear' — resets conversation history
- AI answers are short by default; ask for more detail if needed
- Switched to llama3.1:8b (light) and qwen2.5:14b-instruct (heavy) models

[ Undo ]

- Undo now works on almost everything: file delete (recoverable via trash), copy,
  create file/folder, write (restores old content), macro add/delete/clear,
  alias add/delete, config set/reset
- Undo history keeps up to 30 steps

[ Macros ]
